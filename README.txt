Easily create, customize, and manage forms within your WordPress dashboard, without any public display.

== Description ==
"Forms Everywhere by Influactive" gives you the power to craft custom forms directly from your WordPress dashboard as if you're creating a post. The beauty? These forms do not have a public display, giving you complete control over their use. Features include:

Create Like a Post: If you're familiar with creating a post in WordPress, you're already a pro at creating a form with our plugin.
Custom Fields: Define your form fields based on your requirements.
Design Control: Tailor the look and feel of your form, ensuring it matches your brand and aesthetic.
Email Rendering: Customize the appearance of your form submissions when they're sent via email.
Private: While the creation process mimics post creation, these forms do not appear publicly on your website.

Upload the forms-everywhere-by-influactive folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory of your website.
Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress.
